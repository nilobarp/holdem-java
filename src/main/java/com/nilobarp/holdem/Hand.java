     * Hands are first sorted by rank, if two ranks are same a tie occurs.

     * score to find the winning hand.
     *
     * Cards are stored in an int array along with their suit information.
     * Each suit is weighed by a numeric value as below:
     * +-------------+
     * Club     | 100
     * Diamond  | 200
     * Hearts   | 300
     * Spade    | 400
     *
     * The value of each suit is added to the card's face value and stored in
     * the int[]. This distinguishes each card in the deck and can be easily
     * analyzed for hand type and score calculations.
     *
     * See Analyzer->reduce() method for reduction process
